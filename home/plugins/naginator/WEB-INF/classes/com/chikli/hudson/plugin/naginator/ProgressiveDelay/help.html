    if a build fails for a reason that cannot be immediately fixed,
    immediate rescheduling may cause a very tight loop.
    combined with publishers like e-mail, IM, this could flood the users.
    <p>
    So to avoid this problem, progressively introduce delay until the next build
    delay = the number of consective build problems * <em>increment</em>
    back off at most <em>max</em>
